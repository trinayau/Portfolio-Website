              Thanks for checking out my portfolio website today!
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-3">Hi there! My name is Trina and I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic software engineer with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I am currently working as a Salesforce software engineer at Ford Motor Company.
           </p>
           <p>
           I live in a quiet and green area of NW London, and my favourite thing to do on the weekends is to take my puppy for long walks in the park with my friends. I also enjoy reading both non-fiction books and fiction, especially webnovels. <br>Check out what I'm reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21585159-trina-yau" target="_blank" class="text-muted">GoodReads</a>!</p>

        <h1 class="mb-4">Why?</h1>
    <p class="mb-3">I first stumbled into the world of coding while working on a super cool digital transformation project for my company. I got to work closely with a team of awesome web developers and I was in awe of the magic they could create with just a few lines of code. I was so surprised when they said that I could learn to build a website too! I started dedicating my evenings to learning more about this mysterious world and before I knew it, I was hooked. I love the way coding makes my brain think and the satisfaction of being able to bring my own unique ideas to life. It's like playing with legos for adults, but way cooler. </p>
    <h1 class="mb-4">How?</h1>
    <p class="mb-3">While I started off self-learning, I felt I hit a wall pretty quickly. I wanted to work on more complicated projects with other developers and level up my backend skills. I went on to graduate from a 13-week tech academy called futureproof in June 2022, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux as well as SQL and NoSQL, Python (Flask and Django), Node.js and Express. I have also experienced how to work agile in a tech team, including using Trello and Jira. Overall it was a fantastic experience and it made me love full stack development. </p>

<p class="mb-3">After completing the bootcamp, I am now contracted until 2024 with Ford Motor Company as a Salesforce Software Engineer. My responsibilities include using Salesforce to support Ford's new agency model.</p>
<h1 class="mb-4">Now.</h1>
<p class="mb-3">These days I am a bit of a hackathon addict, and have completed 5 hackathons in the last 6 months. You can check out my projects <a href="work.html">here.</a></p>
<p class="mb-3">I am currently working with Presidium Network, a UK charity, to build the first humanitarian aid logistics app to support their work in crisis zones such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, as an extension of my hackathon project that I built for them.</p>
<p>I'm also constantly working on levelling up my skills, and I am learning Next.js, TypeScript and UI/UX design.</p>
