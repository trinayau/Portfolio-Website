            <p class="mb-3">Currently, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Cisco Systems UK in Hybrid Cloud Operations. I also previously worked as a Salesforce Developer in the automotive industry. I am a qualified Pharmacist and worked for 3 years in the pharmaceutical industry as a Project Manager, managing the development of generic and veterinary medicines in EMEA.

           I live in NW London, and my favourite thing to do on the weekends is to take my puppy for long walks in the park with my friends. I enjoy reading novels, especially webnovels.

        <h1 class="mb-4">Why?</h1>
    <p class="mb-3">I first stumbled into coding while working on a cool digital transformation project for a pharmaceutical company. <br>I got to work closely with a team of awesome web developers and I was in awe of the magic they could create with just a few lines of code.<br>
     I was so surprised when they said that I could learn to build a website too! I started dedicating evenings and weekends to SheCodes, freeCodeCamp and Codecademy, studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I love the way coding makes my brain think and the satisfaction of being able to bring my own ideas to life. <br>
    It's like playing with legos for adults, but way cooler. </p>
    <h1 class="mb-4">How?</h1>
    <p class="mb-3">While I started off self-learning, I hit a wall pretty quickly. What technology should I use? How should I structure my files? What are pull requests even for? There wasn't anyone who I could work with on projects. 
    <br><br> I went on to train at a coding bootcamp in London, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux as well as SQL and NoSQL, Python (Flask and Django), Node.js and Express. I finally got to work with awesome devs, using Trello and Jira to work agile and collaborate on full-stack web projects. It was a fantastic experience and made me determined to build more full stack projects. </p>

<p class="mb-3">After completing the bootcamp, I contracted at Ford Motor Company as a Salesforce Software Engineer. My responsibilities included developing UI using Lightning Web Components and Apex.</p>
<h1 class="mb-4">Now.</h1>
<p class="mb-3">I am now working at Cisco UKI as a Site Reliability Engineer in Hybrid Cloud Operations. I am responsible for the availability, performance, monitoring, and incident response of the Cisco Managed Hybrid Cloud Services Platform. I am also working on automating the deployment of the Managed OpenStack project using Terraform and Ansible. </p>
<p>I'm also constantly working on levelling up my skills, and I am learning Next.js, TypeScript and UI/UX design.</p>
