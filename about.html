            <p class="mb-3">Hi there! My name is Trina and I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic software engineer with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I am currently working as a Salesforce software engineer at Ford Motor Company.
           </p>
           <p>
           I live in a quiet and green area of NW London, and my favourite thing to do on the weekends is to take my puppy for long walks in the park with my friends. I also enjoy reading both non-fiction books and fiction, especially webnovels. <br>Check out what I'm reading on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21585159-trina-yau" target="_blank" class="text-muted">GoodReads</a>!</p>

    <p class="mb-3">I completed a 13-week tech academy called futureproof in June 2022, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux as well as SQL and NoSQL, Python (Flask and Django), Node and Express. I have also learnt agile ways of working in a tech team, including the use of Trello and Jira. </p>

<p class="mb-3">After completing the bootcamp, I am now contracted until 2024 with Ford Motor Company as a Salesforce Software Engineer. My responsibilities include building out features for Ford using Salesforce.com as a CRM Platform Developer.</p>
                <p class="mb-3">I first became interested in coding after working on a digital transformation project for my company, working closely with web developers to revamp our company website. After dedicating my evenings to learning how to code, I found myself enjoying the process and committing increasing time to it. I love the logical nature of coding and found a new satisfaction in being able to apply this to solving problems and creating visual outputs that are unique to me.</p>
<p class="mb-3">I am currently working on a project to build a website for a local charity, which will be a platform for people to donate to the charity and also to find out more about the charity's work.  </p>

<p>My technical skills currently include React, Redux, Django, Python, Figma, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Jest and also Jira and Rally. </p>
<p class="mb-3">These days I am a bit of a hackathon addict</p>
