              Frontend Developer, based in London, United Kingdom
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-3">I am a pharmacist and front-end developer. I was born in Singapore and currently live in a quiet area of NW London. I love making beautiful responsive websites and I am currently learning Python and React as part of my web development journey.</p>

    <div class="about-me container">
                <p class="mb-3">I first became interested in coding after being inspired by a close friend who built a career in the technology industry in just two years, from a position of not knowing how to code at all. After dedicating my evenings to learning how to code, I found myself enjoying the process and committing increasing time to it. I love the logical nature of coding and found a new satisfaction in being able to apply this to solving problems and creating visual outputs that are unique to me.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">I started looking for resources that would help me learn to code. I found that SheCodes' online coding workshops offered me a self-paced introduction to front-end development using HTML5, CSS, Javascript ES6 and the opportunity to code real-life projects. I used what I learnt to code the projects that you can see <a href="/work.html" title="Trina's work">here</a>.
</p>
<p class="mb-3"> After talking to peers in the tech industry and researching online, I realised that a career in tech would also combine aspects I enjoy from my work in the pharmaceutical industry, such as the creative and problem-solving aspects, with what I want in the future: to work collaboratively with peers in a challenging and innovative environment.
</p>
<p>I am currently looking for opportunities to develop my skills in full-stack development into a career, so please reach out to me with work opportunities below.</p>
